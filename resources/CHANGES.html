<h1>Changes</h1>

<p>The latest version is 1.0  To update, remove the watchface from your
watch and then load it again from your locker.</p>

<p>The iOS version has to go through the Apple Store approval process - so
there will be a delay before iOS users are able to download the latest
version.  Wait for the Pebble app to update, then try updating the
watchface. (I havn't access to an iphone)</p>

<p>Android users do not need to wait for the Pebble app to update before
updating the watchface.</p>
