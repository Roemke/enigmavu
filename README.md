EnigmaVu - Remote control
==========================================

A simple remote Control for a satellite receiver.
The receiver must support the Enigma2 Web-Interface.
The following keys are supported, tested with vu+ Solo2

Left / Back - go back one level. 

Upper Button: Sends Arrow key to receiver. 
On my Box the programs appear on the tv screen and
whith up and down button you can scroll through the 
programs. 
Middle / Select Button sends ok.

Middle Button / Select: If your are not in Arrow Mode or
in Volume Mode, this sends the power on/off signal to
the receiver.

Lower Button. Sends Volume down to receiver.
With the up/down Buttons you can control the Volume.
Middle Button leaves this mode (back button also leaves).

If you choose acceleration sensor in config, you can
control the movement of volume and program by turning
your wrist. Turn forward means down, backwards is up.
This is somewhat experimental ...
